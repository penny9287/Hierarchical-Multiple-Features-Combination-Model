# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to count the number of epochs?

OpenNMT-tf uses a step-based training that makes it difficult to track the number of epochs over the dataset. However, it is possible to run the training epoch by epoch with the following configuration:

```yaml
train:
  train_steps: null
  single_pass: true
```

and then:

```text
onmt-main train [...]  # 1st epoch
onmt-main train [...]  # 2nd epoch
...
```

which you can wrap in a shell loop for example.

## How to continue training with different optimization settings?

By default, OpenNMT-tf continues the training where it left off, including the state of the optimizer. To change the optimization settings, the recommended approach is to start a fresh training and only load the model weights from the previous checkpoint:

1. In your configuration, set `model_dir` to a new directory to start a new training
2. On the command line, set `--checkpoint_path` to the checkpoint from where to load the model weights
